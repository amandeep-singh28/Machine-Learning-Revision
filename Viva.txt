(i) Basic things

->How to create a Dataframe?
pd.DataFrame({
    'Col1_name' : [val1, val2, val3],
    'Col2_name' : [val1, val2, val3]
})

->For X(Independent Variable -> Predictors) and y(Dependent Variable -> Target Variable)
X -> 2D array
y -> 1D array

->Label Encoding
It converts categorical values into numerical values. Each unique category gets a unique number.

->Dummy Encoding(One Hot Encoding)
It converts categorical values into binary columns. Each unique value behaves as a new column.

->Discretization
Converting numerical values into categorical values is known as Discretization.

->Feature Scaling
It is used to scaled our values so that one value should not dominate over another value. There are two types of techniques:-
    (i)Normalization(Min-Max Scaling)
        * It is used when our data is not normally distributed.
        * There is a boundation in the output([0,1]).
        * It is used in distance based models.
        * X - Xmin / Xmax - Xmin
    (ii)Standardization(Z-Score)
        * It used when our data is normally distributed.
        * There is no boundation in the output([Min, Max]).
        * It is used in linear models.
        * X - u / sigma

->Supervised Learning
It is a type of learning which is performed on labelled data which means that each input has its known correct output.
For example:- Email Spam or Ham, House price prediction, etc.

->Unsupervised Learning
It is a type of learning which is performed on unlabelled data which means that there is only 1 input feature and model tries to learn patterns in it.
For example:- Customer Segmentation.

->Semi-Supervised Learning
Small amount of labelled data and large amount of unlabelled data.
For example:- Image classification where only few images are labelled.

->Reinforced Learning
Models learns the data through reward and punishment. Model learns by trial and error, gets reward  for correct action and peanlty for wrong action.
For example-> Game pkayingh like Chess,
